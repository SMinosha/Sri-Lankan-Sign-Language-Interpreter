Steps :

1.Run set_hand_histogram.py to set the hand histogram for creating gestures.

2.Save he histogram in the code folder.

3.Create new gestures by running create_gestures.py and stores them in a database.
 
4.Add different variations to the gestures using Rotate_images.py.

5.To split all the captured gestures into training, validation and test set, Run load_images.py.

6.Run display_gestures.py to view the gestures.

7 Run cnn_model_train.py to train the model.

8.Run final.py to start the gesture recognition window and the webcam will use to interpret the trained gestures.
